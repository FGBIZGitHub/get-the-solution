# Possible workaround when .Net Native fails

When creating app Packages for window store, the ARM version faild with:

Matt from .Net Native was so kind to help me out here with the following:

It’s quite likely that the optimizer has botched something. One interesting check is:

- Set to DEBUG config
- Turn on .NET Native in the DEBUG config (Project Properties > BUILD > Enable .NET Native)
- Build and see if it repros!

This config will disable the optimizer for your entire project. If it causes the issue to disappear then it’s just a hunt to see which methods/types we’re having trouble with. If it works in the DEBUG configuration but with .NET Native enabled then you may be able to get a working RELEASE build by selectively disabling the optimizer. Here’s an example of how to do this by Type/Namespace/Assembly:

- Open Properties\Default.rd.xml
- Add: `<Type Name=”FullyQualified.TypeName” DoNotOptimize=”true” DoNotInline=”true”/>`
- Or: `<Namespace Name=”Name.Space” DoNotOptimize=”true” DoNotInline=”true”/>`
- Or: `<Assembly Name=”Assembly.Name.Without.Extension” DoNotOptimize=”true” DoNotInline=”true”/>`

Disabling things one assembly at a time lets you make reasonable progress without driving yourself mad. If that strategy ends up working out for you, then you’re good to go. The Default.rd.xml file comes along when you submit your application to the Store so the Store compile will look more or less identical to your local compile.

I followed the above steps and was able to figure out that the `ImageSharp` assembly or one of its dependcies caused the issue. So I added an entry for ImageSharp in `Properties\Default.rd.xml` to disable .NET Native and volia, the ARM Release build could be completed!

```xml
    <Assembly Name="SixLabors.ImageSharp" DoNotOptimize="true" DoNotInline="true" />
```

The downside of this workaround is that .NET Native for `ImageSharp` is disabled for the other platforms (x86 and x64) as well (when publishing) which has a big perfomance impact. For example resizing a gif picture using `ImageSharp` with .NET Native enabled takes about 40s while the disabled version execution time is around one minute and 20 seconds!

A manual workaround would be to create a seperate `appxupload` package for each platform and adjust the `Default.rd.xml` to enable (`DoNotOptimize="false"`) and disable (`DoNotOptimize="true"`) .NET Native for `ImageSharp` before building it. The result would be to have one `ARM` and one `x64|x86` appxupload package which is not ideal.

A much more elegant way would be to automate the enabling and disabling process of .NET Native for `ImageSharp`. As the `Default.rd.xml` is a simple xml file we can create a simple powershell script which disables the .NET Native for `ImageSharp` on the ARM platform and enables it for all other platforms for us. I named the script `dotnativeAdapter.ps1` which expects the used platform (`x86,x64,ARM or ARM64`) as parameter. Based on this parameter we decide how to set `DoNotOptimize` in `Default.rd.xml`.

```powershell
   param([string]$platform)

   Write-Host $platform

   $file = "./Properties/Default.rd.xml"
   $xml = [xml](Get-Content($file))

   if($platform.ToLower() -contains 'arm') 
   {
     Write-Host "disable native for SixLabors.ImageSharp for $platform"
     $xml.Directives.Application.Assembly[1].DoNotOptimize="true";
     $xml.Directives.Application.Assembly[1].DoNotInline="true";
   }
   else
   {
     Write-Host "enable native for SixLabors.ImageSharp for $platform"
     $xml.Directives.Application.Assembly[1].DoNotOptimize="false";
     $xml.Directives.Application.Assembly[1].DoNotInline="false";
   }

   $xml.Save($file)


```

Now we must intercept before the build process gets triggered to execute our powershell script. This can be accomplised by unloading the the `.csproj` and add the following lines at the end of the document:

```xml
  ...
  <Target Name="BeforeBuild">
    <Message Text="Adapting Default.rd.xml for $(Platform)" Importance="normal" />
    <Exec Command="powershell.exe -NonInteractive -executionpolicy Unrestricted -command &quot;&amp; { .\dotnativeAdapter.ps1 $(Platform) } &quot;" LogStandardErrorAsError="True" ContinueOnError="False" WorkingDirectory="$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)" />
  </Target>
  ...
</Project>
```

With this approach things get much easier - we don't need to worry about creating multiple `appxupload` files or forgetting to adjust the `Default.rd.xml` and also it's a good solution when working with `azure-pipelines`.
