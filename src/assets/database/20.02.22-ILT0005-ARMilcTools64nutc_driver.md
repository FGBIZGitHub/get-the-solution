# Possible workaround when .Net Native fails

When creating the app Packages for the windows store, the ARM version faild with:

Matt from .Net Native was so kind to help me out here with the following:

It’s quite likely that the optimizer has botched something. One interesting check is:

- Set to DEBUG config
- Turn on .NET Native in the DEBUG config (Project Properties > BUILD > Enable .NET Native)
- Build and see if it repros!

This config will disable the optimizer for your entire project. If it causes the issue to disappear then it’s just a hunt to see which methods/types we’re having trouble with. If it works in the DEBUG configuration but with .NET Native enabled then you may be able to get a working RELEASE build by selectively disabling the optimizer. Here’s an example of how to do this by Type/Namespace/Assembly:

- Open Properties\Default.rd.xml
- Add: `<Type Name=”FullyQualified.TypeName” DoNotOptimize=”true” DoNotInline=”true”/>`
- Or: `<Namespace Name=”Name.Space” DoNotOptimize=”true” DoNotInline=”true”/>`
- Or: `<Assembly Name=”Assembly.Name.Without.Extension” DoNotOptimize=”true” DoNotInline=”true”/>`

Disabling things one assembly at a time lets you make reasonable progress without driving yourself mad. If that strategy ends up working out for you, then you’re good to go. The Default.rd.xml file comes along when you submit your application to the Store so the Store compile will look more or less identical to your local compile.

I followed the above steps and was able to figure out that the `ImageSharp` assembly or one of its dependcies caused the issue. So I added the proper values to `Properties\Default.rd.xml` and volia, the ARM Release build is now working too!

```xml
    <Assembly Name="SixLabors.ImageSharp" DoNotOptimize="true" DoNotInline="true" />
```

The downside of this workaround seems to be that you have to create the app packges (when publishing) seperatly . Selecting x86, x64 and ARM with the modified `Default.rd.xml` and create one `*ARM_x86_x64_bundle.appxupload` didn't work out for me.
