# Signal Processing introduction

A signal is defined as any physical or virtual quantity that varies with time or space or any other independent variable.

Expressing a signal in a mathematically way, it can be written as a function of an independent variable which varies for example in time. Signals occour in diffrent enviroments and are therefore categorized into the continuous time domain and discret time domain. Furthermore you can distinguish signals into periodically and not periodically signals.

Signal in continuous time domain are notated

$x(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T$

Signal in discrete time domain are notated

$x[n], n = 0, 1, · · · , N$

Example Signals: Picture file (discrete), audio file (discrete), voltage, speech (continuous), temperatur sensor, ...

## Sampling frequency

When working with signals, for computers its more convenient and efficent to work with discrete values.
This requires an ability to convert signals from the the continuous time domain to the discrete time domain and visa verce.

As the continues time domain is infinitly, the "sampling technique" provides an ability to make some kind of a snapshop of the continuous time signal. Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency).

Definitions of sampling frequency (fs):

SI Unit of frequency: Hz [$s^{-1}$]

$f_s = \frac{AmountOfEvents}{unitOfTime}$

$T_s$ = distanc between samples

$f = \frac{1}{T}$

Note: Sampling frequency is the frequency of taking samples and differs from the signal frequencies.

Example 1:

![Fig. 1. sampling frequency sample](assets/img/blog/sip/sampling_frequency_sample.png){ width=240 }

Notice: Event number 5. is not considered as it belongs to the next "snapshot".

$f_s = \frac{4}{1s}=4Hz$

$T_s = \frac{1}{4s}$

$f = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}s}$=4Hz

Example 2:

![Fig. 2. sampling frequency sample](assets/img/blog/sip/sampling_frequency_sample2.png){ width=240 }

Notice: Event number 10. is not considered as it belongs to the next "snapshot".

$f_s = \frac{10}{1s}=10Hz$

Amplitude for  x[2]=2,x[4]=2, x[5]=1,

The sampling process from the continues time domain to discret time domain can be annotated like the following:

$x(t) -> x(nTs) : x[n]$

Values from continuous time domain -> only take values of x we observed at the time nTs : to retriev the values for x[n]

![Fig. 3. discrete signal example](assets/img/blog/sip/discrete_signal_example.png){ width=240 }

Note: From the above sample we cannot determine what the sampling frequency was as we dont know how much time was used for how many samples.

## Impulse signal - Dirac delta function

continuous

There exists signal processing systems which can manipulate signals. They consist of a signal input, signal proccessing unit and signal output (Think of the IPO model).

## Characteristics Of Signal

Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) showed that, complicated but periodic functions are written as the sum of simple waves mathematically represented by sines and cosines. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Introduction)

Knowing that a compilated periodic signal is composed of several other signals enables us to filter or amplify certain signal of interesst.

Every periodic oscillation can be approximated with a harmonic sum of sin- or cos-oscillation [3](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ws1011/dm/dm4.pdf).

...

$x(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k*cos(k*\omega_0*t+\theta_k)$

### Frequency

Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) defined by:

$f = \frac{1}{T}$

A sampling frequency contains the amount 
$f_s ... sampling frequency
$T_s ... distance between samples

As a example: Sine wave of various frequencies,

## Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)

## Sampling (Continues time signal to discret signal)

continues in time, sample signal, to obtain

on which conditions we can reconstrcut continues time signal from discret signal?
-> under certain conditions its possible to reconstruct from discret signal to the full continues time signal

X(t)->sample -> X[n]-> reconstruct X(t)
