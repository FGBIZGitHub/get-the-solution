# Signal Processing Overview

## Frequency

Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) defined by:

$f = \frac{1}{T}$

As a example: Sine wave of various frequencies,

![(sin wave)](assets/img/sin-waves-diffrent-frequencies.png){ width=120 }

the bottom waves have higher frequencies than those above.

$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$

## Sampling (Continues time signal to discret signal)

continues in time, sample signal, to obtain 

on which conditions we can reconstrcut continues time signal from discret signal?
-> under certain conditions its possible to reconstruct from discret signal to the full continues time signal

X(t)->sample -> X[n]-> reconstruct X(t)
