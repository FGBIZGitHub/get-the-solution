# Signal Processing introduction

A signal is defined as any physical or virtual quantity that varies with time or space or any other independent variable.

Expressing a signal in a mathematically way, it can be written as a function of an independent variable which varies for example in time. Signals occour in diffrent enviroments and are therefore categorized into the continious time domain and discret time domain. Furthermore you can distinguish signals into periodically and not periodically signals.

Signal in continuous time domain are notated

$x(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T$

Signal in discrete time domain are notated

$x[n], n = 0, 1, · · · , N$

There exists signal processing systems which can manipulate signals. They consist of a signal input, signal proccessing unit
and signal output (Think of the IPO model).

Sample Signals: Picture, audio, voltage, ...

Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) showed that, complicated but periodic functions are written as the sum of 
simple waves mathematically represented by sines and cosines. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Introduction)
    
Knowing that a compilated periodic signal is composed of several other signals enables us to filter or amplify 
certain signal of interesst. 

Every periodic oscillation can be approximated with a harmonic sum of sin- or cos-oscillation [3](https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ws1011/dm/dm4.pdf).

$x(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k*cos(k*\omega_0*t+\theta_k)$

### Frequency

Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) defined by:

$f = \frac{1}{T}$

As a example: Sine wave of various frequencies,

## Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)

## Sampling (Continues time signal to discret signal)

continues in time, sample signal, to obtain 

on which conditions we can reconstrcut continues time signal from discret signal?
-> under certain conditions its possible to reconstruct from discret signal to the full continues time signal

X(t)->sample -> X[n]-> reconstruct X(t)
