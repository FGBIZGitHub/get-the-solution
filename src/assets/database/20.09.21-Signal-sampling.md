## Sampling frequency

When working with signals, for computers its more convenient and efficent to work with discrete values.
This requires an ability to convert signals from the the continuous time domain to the discrete time domain and visa verce.
As the continues time domain is infinitly, the "sampling technique" provides an ability to make some kind of snapshots of the continuous time signal. The number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) is the so called frequency.

Definitions of sampling frequency (fs):

SI Unit of frequency: Hz [$s^{-1}$]

$f_s = \frac{AmountOfEvents}{unitOfTime}$

$T_s$ = distanc between samples

$f = \frac{1}{T}$

Note: Sampling frequency is the frequency of taking samples and differs from the signal frequencies.

Example 1:

![Fig. 1. sampling frequency sample](assets/img/blog/sip/sampling_frequency_sample.png)

Notice: Event number 5. is not considered as it belongs to the next "snapshot".

$f_s = \frac{4}{1s}=4Hz$

$T_s = \frac{1}{4s}$

$f = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}s}$=4Hz

## Windowing

### Window Design

We have given an infinity long signal and we only observed it in a finite "window".

![(Fig 2. signal and window function)](assets/img/blog/sip/window_design_sample.png){ width=480 }

The observed signal can be retrieved by multiplying the window function with its original signal. The window function can be for instance rectangular one and is outside of the "window" zero. $\hat{x}=w[n]\cdot x[n]$.

![(Fig 3. frequency window function)](assets/img/blog/sip/window_frequency.png){ width=480 }

The specturm of the rectangular window function will result in a sinc function.
Designing window functions result in a trade off. You can choose between stronger desortions for the locally frequencies and weaker desortions for those who are further away. Or you do it the other way around.

Note: You cannot avoid some desortions of your spectrum for the final signal length part. But you can choose by the window function how your spectrum gets distorted.

One of the most popular windows is the [Hann window function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann_function).

Observing a signal for a final length distorts the specturm and may it make difficult to properly resolve all the sepctrums components of the signal. Shorter the signal is the more servier the distortions.

## Sampling signal

Sampling is the process from "converting" a signal from the continues time domain to a discrete time signal. Under certain conditions its possible to reconstruct the continues signal from the discrete signal.

$f_s...sampling frequency$

![(Fig 4. sampling)](assets/img/blog/sip/sampling.png){ width=480 }

With the function S(t) we generate spikes at a fixed time interval in the continues time domain (dirac impulse)

$S(t)=\sum_{\infty}^{n=-\infty} \delta(t-nTs); f_s=1/T_s$

Calculate the discrete time signal $X_s(t)$ by:

$X_s(t)=X(t)*S(t)=\sum_{\infty}^{n=-\infty}  x[n]\cdot \delta(t-nTs)$

x[n]...where we want to sample

$\Omega$...frequency in the continues Time domain (pysical units in Hz)

$\omega$...discrit time series frequency

Calculate the spectrum of $X_s(\Omega)$

$X_s(\Omega)=\frac{1}{T_s}\sum_{\infty}^{k=-\infty} X(\Omega-k\cdot\Omega_s); Omega_s=2\cdot\pi\cdot f_s$

$S(\Omega)=\frac{2\cdot\pi}{T_s}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(\Omega-k\cdot\Omega_s)$

From the modulation theorem we know that the spectrum of our sample signal is given by our original signal convoled with our sampling function:

$X_s(\Omega)=X(\Omega)*S(\Omega)$

The specturm of Xs(t) is shifted infinite k-times.

### Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem

Let X(t) be a bandlimited signal with $X(\Omega)=0 for | \Omega | \geq\Omega_N$.
Then x(t) is uniquely determined by its samples x[n]=(nTs) if the sampling frequeuncy $\Omega_s\geq 2\Omega_N$

For example: Audiofiles. Human is able to hear or recognize noises with a frequencie up to 22kHz. For this reason the signal needs to be sampled with a sampling frequency of 44kHz.

## Relation of Ω and ω

$\Omega\cdot T\cdot s=\omega$

$f=\frac{\omega\cdot f_s}{2\cdot\pi}$

Sample:

Lets assume we have a discrite time signal $X(\omega)$ with a spectrum from $-\pi$ to $\pi$
Now we want to know, to which pysical frequencies $X(\omega)$ is correspondending?

$f_{\omega=\pi}=\frac{\pi\cdot f_s}{2\cdot\pi}=\frac{f_s}{2}$

$f_{\omega=-\pi}=-\frac{f_s}{2}$

This means if we for example sample a signal at 1kHz and compute the DFT and plot the spectrum from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ over the frequencies from -500Hz to + 500Hz.

## Relation of the sampling frequency, window length and the frequency resolution

-> Sampling frequency has no impact to the frequency resolution.

Frequency resolution is determined by its window length

N... length of signal

$frequency-resolution-(pysical)=\frac{f_s}{N}=\frac{f_s}{T\cdot f_s}=\frac{1}{T}$

For example: Record an audiosignal for one 1s. Then the DFT gives gives us a frequency of 1Hz. Record 10s frequency resolution is 0.1Hz. This means we need a certain frequency resolution to resolve osciallations on which we are intressted in. If the recording window is too short than the frequency resolution is maybe to coarse grain to see whats actual going on.

## Resampling

Change the sampling rate after the signal was recorded. For example we want to do that to save storage on the computer.

### Downsampling

Naiv down sampling: by a factor of two we set every second signal to 0 (drop every second sample).
To downsample by an integer factor u, we first have to aplly a lowpass-filter at cut off frequencies $+-\frac{\pi}{u}$, and then compute the new signal $x_d[n]=x_{LowPass}[u\cdot n]$

### Upsampling

For example upsampling signal x[n] by a factor L=2 to the new signal $x_u[n]$.
We need to reconstruct every second signal. We can do that for example with a linear interpolation, which is not a good practice. Better do it with:

$x_u[n]=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty}x[k]\cdot\delta[n-k\cdot L]$

$X_u(\omega)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty}x[n]\cdot e^{-j\omega\cdot L\cdot k}=X(\omega L)$

Upsampling by creating a new upsampled signal $x_u[n]=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty}x[k]\cdot\delta[n-k\cdot L]$ and than apply low pass filter with cut off frequency $\frac{+\pi}{-L}$.

General Resampling $\frac{L}{u}$: First upsample by L, then downsample by u.

In principal we can resample at any frequncy we like. However there is one small thing to take in consideration. It could be that to resample by one specific fraction we first have to upsample by a very large number L before downlsampling again by a very large numer m and this upsampling takes an extra ordinary amount of memory. If not careful enough you we can run into compution problems.
