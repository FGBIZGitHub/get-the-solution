# The hilbert transform

This text is from the category [SIP (Signal and image proccessing)](category/sip). Previous text [signal sampling](blog/Signal%20filtering)

signals in the time domain are dynamic as the time series is changing in time. if we transform them to the frequency domain we lose this time component. now the time series is expressed by a sum of oscillations and every oscillation is time invariant as it has a fixed amplitude and a fixed phase.
the linear superposition of all the oscillations generates the time series.

The fourier transform gives a spectrum decomposition which is constant in time. Osciallation that change amplitude and phase instantaneous.

instantaneous:

- instantaneous amplitude |Z(t)|
- instantaneous phase $\sphericalangle Z(t)$
- instantaneous frequency $\frac{d \sphericalangle Z(t)}{dt}$

Assume that |Z(t)| and $\frac{d \sphericalangle Z(t)}{dt}$ are constant and considered the projection of Z(t) onto the real axis: Re{Z(t)}=Z(t)

By the hilbert transform we aim to reconstruct a complex-valued signal from its projection to the real axis.

We want to reconstruct the analytic signal:

$Z[n]=Z_r[n]+jZ_i[n]$

We want to reconstruct $Z_i[n]$ from Z_r[n]=x[n].
How do we choose $Z_i[n]$?
Consider $x[n]=A cos(\omega\cdot n)=Re\{|z|\cdot e^{j\omega\cdot n}\}$
$Z[n]=Asin(\omega n)=A\cdot cos(\omega n-frac{\pi}{2}$

By delaying x[n] by pi/2 we can reconstruct an analytic signal that, for x[n] a pure osciallation, hast a constant amplitude and a linear phase (linear frequency).

Extend this idea to signals composed of multiple oscillation.
