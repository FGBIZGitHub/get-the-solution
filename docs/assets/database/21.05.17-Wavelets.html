<p>Beside the discrete fourier transformation there exists another type of transformation which is called the discrete wavelet transformation which can be used to analyze the spectrum of a signal. Its particular useful to analyze dynamic signals, signals which change there spectral properties over time, like the following example.</p>

<p>The above signals oscillation is from <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> fast, but the oscillation gets much slower from <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>. Doing the &quot;normal&quot; discrete time fourier transformation to retrieve the amplitude spectrum <span class="math inline">\(|X(\omega)|\)</span> would look like the following plot.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>
<p>Without the plot of x(t) and only observing the plot <span class="math inline">\(|X(\omega)|\)</span> you can get the wrong imagination that the signal looks like a fast and a slow oscillation on top of each other.</p>
<h2 id="short-discrete-time-fourier-transformation">short discrete (time) fourier transformation</h2>
<p>For this kind of situations it makes sense to analyse the signal in a more dynamic kind of fashion.</p>
<p>Idea: Perform <em>short</em> but multiple discrete time fourier transformation (STFT) using windows (moving and potentially overlapping) windows -&gt; Short time fourier transformation (S(T)FT). This can be expressed like the following:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X(\omega_i,\tau)=\sum_{\infty}^{n=-\infty}w[n-\tau]\cdot x[n]\cdot e^{-j\omega n}\)</span></p>
<p>w[n]...some window of length M.</p>
<p>Plotting the <span class="math inline">\(|X(\omega_i)|\)</span> the Time-frequency plane results in a 2d plot. The time resolution is determined by the window length M. For example assume M=100 and <span class="math inline">\(f_s=100Hz\)</span>. fast oscillation changes Amplitude quickly.</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/blog/sip/stft-time-frequency-plane.png" alt="Fig. 3." width="440" /> <img src="assets/img/blog/sip/stft-time-frequency-plane2.png" alt="Fig. 4." width="440" /></p>
<p>In the left figure you can see that the resolution is constant. You can choose higher frequency resolution but then you haver a lower time resolution and visa verse. The frequency resolution is always constant along the frequency-axes. With the above <span class="math inline">\(f_s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> the frequency resolution would be 1 Hz.</p>
<p>We know that slow oscillation tend to change the amplitude slowly and fast oscillations tend to change the amplitude quickly. In some situations like in image signals or time signals it makes sense to drop the constant grid. Like in the right figure (time frequency plane with other grid). It illustrates that low frequencies got a long time resolution and as you move up to higher frequencies the time resolution gets doubled and the frequency resolution gets halved.</p>
<h2 id="the-discrete-wavelet-transformation-dwt">The discrete Wavelet transformation (DWT)</h2>
<p>Given a mother wavelet h[n] of length M, we define</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(h_{m,k}[n]=2^{\frac{-m}{k}}\cdot h[2^{-m}\cdot n-k\cdot2^{-m}\cdot M];m,k\in\mathbb{N}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2^{-m}\)</span>... scaling of mother wavelet</p>
<p>k... shift of wavelet of length M</p>
<p>The DWT is given by</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X[m,k]=2^{\frac{-m}{2}}\cdot\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\cdot h[2^{-m}n-k2^{-m}M]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(h[2^{-m}n-k2^{-m}M]\)</span>...basis function</p>
<p>m... frequency parameter k... position</p>
<p>How do we design a mother wavelet that has the properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(&lt;h_{m,k}[n],h_{m&#39;,k&#39;}[n]&gt;=\delta_{m,k}\cdot\delta_{m&#39;,k&#39;}\)</span></li>
<li>orthogonal basis (inner product of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;h_{m,k}[n],h_{m&#39;,k&#39;}[n]&gt;\)</span> should be zero)</li>
<li>inner product of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;h_{m,k}[n],h_{m&#39;,k&#39;}[n]&gt;\)</span> should be one if we have same scaling and same position</li>
</ul>
<p>With orthogonal projection we can (as we did with the D(T)FT) from our time domain to the wavelet domain.</p>
<p>There are different mother wavelets which provide the above property.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(h[n]=\begin{cases} 1;0\le n\le\frac{M}{2} \\ -1;\frac{M}{2}&lt;n&lt;M \\ 0; otherwise \end{cases}\)</span></p>

<p>Any set of N paris of (m,k) gives a orthonormal basis <span class="math inline">\(h_{m,k}[n]\)</span></p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(h[n]=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3\cdot\sigma}\cdot\pi^{1/4}}(1-({\frac{n}{\sigma}})^2)\cdot e^{-\frac{n^2}{2\cdot\sigma^2}}\)</span></p>
<p>The mexican hat wavelets gives rise to an orthonormal basis but has infinite support.</p>
<h2 id="daubechies">Daubechies</h2>
<p>Compact support (final length), gives rise to orthonormal basis, but has no analytics expression.</p>
<p>Summary: Design mother wavelet shift and translate, and every shift and translation gives a new basis function.</p>
